							Look at this stuff<br>
							Isn't it neat?<br>
							Wouldn't you think my collection's complete?<br>
							Wouldn't you think I'm the girl<br>
							The girl who has ev'rything?<br>
							Look at this trove<br>
							Treasures untold<br>
							How many wonders can one cavern hold?<br>
							Lookin' around here you'd think<br>
							(Sure) she's got everything<br>
							<br>
							I've got gadgets and gizmos aplenty<br>
							I've got whozits and whatzits galore<br>
							(You want thingamabobs?<br>
							I got twenty)<br>
							But who cares?<br>
							No big deal<br>
							I want more<br>
							<br>
							I want to be where the people are<br>
							I want to see<br>
							want to see 'em dancin'<br>
							Walkin' around on those<br>
							(Whad'ya call 'em?) oh - feet<br>
							Legs are required for jumpin', dancin'<br>
							Strollin' along down a<br>
							(What's that word again?) street<br>
							<br>
							Up where they walk<br>
							Up where they run<br>
							Up where they stay all day in the sun<br>
							Wanderin' free<br>
							Wish I could be<br>
							Part of that world<br>
							<br>
							What would I give<br>
							If I could live<br>
							Outta these waters?<br>
							What would I pay<br>
							To spend a day<br>
							Warm on the sand?
							Betcha on land<br>
							They understand<br>
							Bet they don't reprimand their daughters<br>
							Bright young women<br>
							Sick o' swimmin<br>
							Ready to stand<br>
							<br>
							And ready to know what the people know<br>
							Ask 'em my questions<br>
							And get some answers<br>
							What's a fire and why does it<br>
							(What's the word?) burn?<br>
							<br>
							When's it my turn?<br>
							Wouldn't I love<br>
							Love to explore that shore above?<br>
							Out of the sea<br>
							Wish I could be<br>
							Part of that world<br>
